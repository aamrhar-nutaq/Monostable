About
-----

Monostable is a Verilog implementation of a monostable multivibrator;
when triggered, it will switch to a high position for a period of clock
ticks, and then return to a low position.

Usage
-----

The "monostable" module implements a monostable multivibrator. It takes
in three inputs (clk, reset, trigger) and outputs a single signal
(pulse). The clk input is the clock; the reset input resets the module;
the trigger input triggers the module; the pulse output is the current
state. The pulse width of the output signal can be set via the
PULSE_WIDTH parameter, which represents the period in clock ticks that
the signal should stay high.

The "delayed_monostable" module implements a monostable multivibrator
with a start-up delay. It has the same inputs and outputs as the
"monostable" module. The delay can be configured via the DELAY_WIDTH
parameter, which represents the time in clock ticks to wait until
triggering the "monostable" module; the pulse width of the triggered
"monostable" module can be set via the SIGNAL_WIDTH parameter, which
represents the period in clock ticks that the signal should stay high.
